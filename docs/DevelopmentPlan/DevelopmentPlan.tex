\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the

\section{Confidential Information?}

The project does not use any confidential information. 

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

There is no IP to protect in this project. 

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

The group has agreed that the project should use a MIT License.

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

The team will meet 1-3 times per week with one in person meeting reoccurring at the same time every week. The meeting will be at a previously agreed upon location that will be discussed privately. Alternatively the meeting may be done virtually. We will meet with industry advisers and  other experts on a scheduled basis. These meetings will be announced beforehand. 

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}


\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}


\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}


\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

The team will use a private discord server along with GitHub for communication. Team members are expected to check both of these daily for updates to meeting times or other milestones.  

\section{Team Member Roles}

We will need a dedicated Team Lead, Keynoter, Team Liaison, Reviewer, Meeting chair.
The team lead is in charge of scheduling meetings and other events that may be needed to complete the project. They Keynoter is in charge of taking notes on any meetings for later use. The Team Liaison is in charge of communicating with the Professor and other external helpers for the project. The reviewer is in charge of reviewing work to ensure it is of high standard. The meeting chair is in charge of managing meeting topics and making sure that the meeting stays productive and relevant. 

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

% \begin{itemize}
	
	% \item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	% \item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	% classification, etc.?
  % \item Use of CI/CD
  
  Our project will be using GitHub for version control and issue tracking. It will be setup with a main branch that is always stable and
  a dev branch will be used for integration of new features. Each feature or fix will first be developed in a separate branch off of dev. 
  Once the feature is complete and tested, a pull request will be created to merge the feature branch into dev. The pull request will be 
  reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged. For smaller changes such as text changes, we will just be using the dev 
  branch directly. The dev branch will be periodically merged into main after thorough testing to ensure stability. 

  % \item Work in individual branches for each new issue/change. 
	% \item Merge with pull requests followed by reviews.
	% \item Use issues for work.
	% \item Use automated tests. 

% \end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Project will be done on GitHub at https://github.com/ritual-17/flow.
  \item The Project is planned to be finished at the end February 
  \item GitHub Projects will be used to help organize issues and assign them to developers. 
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
  
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

The main risk of the project is that our Proof of Concept will not be less efficient and flexible than other existing note taking software. Alternately, we could compare our software to analogy note taking methods. To demonstrate the risk we can compare them to other notes, either analog or digital. 

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language : Electron \& TypeScript (Subject to Change)
\item Specific libraries : TBD
\item Pre-trained models : N/A
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate) : TBD
\item Specific unit testing framework : TBD
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools : TBD
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done : Github and GitHub Projects
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate : N/A
\item Tools you will likely be using? : Discord (to communicate)
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

TBD once coding starts

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}
Show up to all meetings unless they have an acceptable excuse or an emergency. 

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}
For in person meetings the person must be unable to reach the meeting position and have the excuses vetted by 3/4 of the other members. The excuses should be communicated as soon as possible.  

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

If a team member has a emergency that impairs their ability to do work they should communicate the other team mates as soon as possible to work out an alternative plan.

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
deliverables that members bring to the team?}
Team mates should have proper tools for meetings to discuss and work on the project.
Code will be reviewed by other team-mates and code of poor quality will be rewritten  until it is of proper quality.

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}



\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

\wss{How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)? }

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

\wss{How will you make decisions in your group? Consensus?  Vote? How will you
handle disagreements? }
