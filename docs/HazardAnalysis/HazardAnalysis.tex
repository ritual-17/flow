\section{Introduction}

% \wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

Analyzing the hazards associated with a system is an important step in
developing a safe and reliable product. It helps identify and evaluate
potential risks that could impact the safety or usability of the system. By
conducting a hazard analysis before development, we can take proactive measures
to mitigate these risks, and design preventative measures to ensure the system
operates as intended.
\\
\\
For our note-taking system (\progname), this analysis focuses on hazards that 
may lead to data loss, perfomance issues, and security vulnerabilities. As 
\progname aims to procide fast keyword-based editing with real-time diagram
rendering, it introduces potential risks in different areas including rendering
performance, data integrity, and user experience.
\\
\\
The following sections of the document define the scope and objectives of the 
hazard analysis, describe the system boundaries and main components of 
\progname, and outline key assumptions that may influence saftey considerations.
The core of the document presents a detailed Failure Mode and Effect Analysis
(FMEA) table, which identifies potential hazards, their causes and effects.
Finally, the document concludes with a summary of safety and security
requirements, and provides a roadmap for implementing these requirements in
future development phases.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

% \wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the hazards.}
The purpose of this hazard analysis is to identify and evaluate the potential 
risks that could impact the safety, security, and usability of \progname. 
Conducting this analysis in the early stages of development allows for us to 
anticipate possible failure points in the system and implement design strategies
to prevent data loss, ensure stable performance, and maintain user confidence.
\\
\\
The text-editing interface, diagram rendering engine, and file storage system all 
make up the core components of \progname. This analysis will focus on both 
software related hazards, such as crashes, performance issues, and 
synchronization errors, as well as user-related risks, including data loss, 
security vulnerabilities, and non-intuitive user interactions.
\\
\\
Losses that may be incurred due as a result of these hazards include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loss of user data} from failed saves, corruption, or unexpected
    application closures
    \item \textbf{Loss of productivity} due to lag, unresponsiveness or
    non-intuitive interface or command design
    \item \textbf{Loss of reliability and maintainability} if the application 
    is developed with technical dept or poor coding practices
    \item \textbf{Loss of user trust} due to repeated bugs, confusing features,
    or inconsistent behavior
    \item \textbf{Loss of security or privacy} if data is not properly protected
    or stored securely
\end{itemize}
\\
\\
The hazard analysis focuses on factors in the software domain only. While
hardware failures (e.g., device crashes, power loss), as well as operating
system issues (e.g., file system corruption, OS crashes) can impact the
performance and reliability of \progname, these are outside the scope of this
analysis. \progname will be running in the user space and any potential
problems occuring at the kernal level or below are will therefore not be 
considered. The analysis will assume that the underlying hardware and OS
are functioning correctly, and will focus on hazards that can be directly
attributed to the design and implementation of \progname itself.


\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
