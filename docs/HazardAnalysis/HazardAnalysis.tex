\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - I found that our team collaborated effectively in dividing the work 
        and keeping our analysis consistent across sections. We communicated clearly about 
        potential hazards and quickly agreed on the scope and structure of the document. 
        Using LaTeX templates also helped maintain a clean and professional format throughout.
        \item Ethan - I think something that went well in this deliverable was
          the team collaboration. Everyone communicated well and we tried our
          best to have PRs up and a proper review process. We learned from our
          last deliverable that saving review to the last minute makes it
          really hard to actually incorporate the feedback, but it was better
          in this milestone.
        \item Hussain - 
        \item Jeffrey - 
        \item Kevin - 
    \end{itemize} 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - A main difficulty was completing some parts of the hazard analysis 
        without direct communication among team members, since it is closely related to the 
        SRS content. Some sections depended on finalized requirements or component details 
        that were still being developed. We resolved this by holding short sync meetings and 
        clarifying assumptions so our analysis stayed consistent with the SRS.
        \item Ethan - It was difficult to think about hazards related to our
          product, since our project is purely software and doesn't really have
          any potential physical harm to users or the environment. We resolved
          this by working as a team and brainstorming other hazard areas that
          we wouldn't typically think of at first.
        \item Hussain - 
        \item Jeffrey - 
        \item Kevin - 
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our team had already identified general risks such as 
        data loss and performance issues early in the SRS phase. However, while 
        doing this deliverable, we recognized new risks related to user input 
        handling and rendering consistency in the canvas editor. These came up 
        as we analyzed possible failure modes and realized how improper error 
        handling or unexpected user actions could lead to crashes or corrupted note files. 
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some important types of risk in software products are data security 
        risks and usability risks. Data security risks, such as unauthorized access or data 
        corruption, can lead to loss of user trust and legal issues. Usability risks, like 
        confusing interfaces or unclear workflows, can reduce user satisfaction and prevent 
        adoption of the software. Considering these risks early helps ensure both system 
        reliability and a positive user experience. Another risk may be financial risk, 
        where project delays or cost overruns could impact the viability of the product.
        If the project runs out of budget or takes too long to deliver, it may not be
        feasible to continue development or support.
    \end{itemize}
