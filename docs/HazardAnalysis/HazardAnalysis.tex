\section{Introduction}

% \wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

Analyzing the hazards associated with a system is an important step in
developing a safe and reliable product. It helps identify and evaluate
potential risks that could impact the safety or usability of the system. By
conducting a hazard analysis before development, we can take proactive measures
to mitigate these risks, and design preventative measures to ensure the system
operates as intended.
\\
\\
For our note-taking system (\progname), this analysis focuses on hazards that 
may lead to data loss, perfomance issues, and security vulnerabilities. As 
\progname aims to procide fast keyword-based editing with real-time diagram
rendering, it introduces potential risks in different areas including rendering
performance, data integrity, and user experience.
\\
\\
The following sections of the document define the scope and objectives of the 
hazard analysis, describe the system boundaries and main components of 
\progname, and outline key assumptions that may influence saftey considerations.
The core of the document presents a detailed Failure Mode and Effect Analysis
(FMEA) table, which identifies potential hazards, their causes and effects.
Finally, the document concludes with a summary of safety and security
requirements, and provides a roadmap for implementing these requirements in
future development phases.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

% \wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the hazards.}
The purpose of this hazard analysis is to identify and evaluate the potential 
risks that could impact the safety, security, and usability of \progname. 
Conducting this analysis in the early stages of development allows for us to 
anticipate possible failure points in the system and implement design strategies
to prevent data loss, ensure stable performance, and maintain user confidence.
\\
\\
The text-editing interface, diagram rendering engine, and file storage system all 
make up the core components of \progname. This analysis will focus on both 
software related hazards, such as crashes, performance issues, and 
synchronization errors, as well as user-related risks, including data loss, 
security vulnerabilities, and non-intuitive user interactions.
\\
\\
Losses that may be incurred due as a result of these hazards include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loss of user data} from failed saves, corruption, or unexpected
    application closures
    \item \textbf{Loss of productivity} due to lag, unresponsiveness or
    non-intuitive interface or command design
    \item \textbf{Loss of reliability and maintainability} if the application 
    is developed with technical dept or poor coding practices
    \item \textbf{Loss of user trust} due to repeated bugs, confusing features,
    or inconsistent behavior
    \item \textbf{Loss of security or privacy} if data is not properly protected
    or stored securely
\end{itemize}

The hazard analysis focuses on factors in the software domain only. While
hardware failures (e.g., device crashes, power loss), as well as operating
system issues (e.g., file system corruption, OS crashes) can impact the
performance and reliability of \progname, these are outside the scope of this
analysis. \progname will be running in the user space and any potential
problems occuring at the kernal level or below are will therefore not be 
considered. The analysis will assume that the underlying hardware and OS
are functioning correctly, and will focus on hazards that can be directly
attributed to the design and implementation of \progname itself.


\section{System Boundaries and Components}

% \wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
% You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
% ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
% each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
% important library, these are also potential components.}
\progname is a note-taking application that allows users to create, edit, and
visualize text-based diagrams using only keyboard inputs. The boundaries of
the system include all components directly related to the core functionality of
the application, including taking user input, rendering diagrams, and file 
management. The system boundary does not include external dependencies such as 
the user's operating system, device hardware, or third-party file storage services 
such as cloud storage providers.
\\
\\
The main components of \progname include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Interface (UI) Layer}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handling user interactions, keyboard inputs, displaying updates
        \item Showing live view of notes and diagrams
        \item Providing feedback on actions (e.g., error messages)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Command Processing Engine}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parsing and interpreting user commands
        \item Managing application state based on user inputs
        \item Sending structured actions to the rendering and storage layers
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diagram Rendering Engine}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Converting text-based diagram descriptions into visual formats
        \item Handling shape layout, positioning, and connection to the rest of
        the note content
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{File Management and Storage Layer}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Saving and loading notes and diagrams to/from disk
        \item Managing file formats and data serialization
        \item Ensuring data integrity during read/write operations
    \end{itemize}\
    \item \textbf{Error Handling and State Management Module}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Detecting, logging, and managing errors across all components
        \item Implementing recovery mechanisms and stability after crashes or
        unexpected shutdowns
    \end{itemize}
    % \item \textbf{Configuration/Customization Module} %potential future 
    % component
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Storing and Managing user preferences and application settings
    % \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

In addition to these core components, \progname may also depend on external
libraries for specific functionalities, such as diagram rendering or parsing.
To generate and display diagrams, the application may utilize a graphics 
library to allow for efficient rendering and manipulation of visual elements.
For parsing user commands, a parsing library may be employed to simplify the
interpretation of complex inputs. State management libraries may also be used
to help maintain application state and ensure consistency across different
components.


\section{Critical Assumptions}

% \wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
% minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
% you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
% this potential failure mode.}
Certain key assumptions will be made regarding the user and operating environment
during the development and use of \progname. These assumptions include:
\\
\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Competency:} It is assumed that users have a basic level
    of computer literacy and is familiar with computer opertations such as using
    a keyboard and mouse. Users are expected to follow reasonable usage patterns
    (e.g. not shutting down the application abruptly or attempting to
    manipulate internal files directly).
    \item \textbf{File Access and Storage:} It is assumed that the file system
    used for storing notes and diagrams is reliable and free from corruption.
    Users are expected to have sufficient permissions to read/write files in
    the designated storage locations.
    \item \textbf{Operating Environment:} It is assumed that \progname will be
    run on a supported operating system without unexpected interruptions such
    as forced shutdowns, crashes, or power failures. The system is expected to
    have adequate disk space and memory to run the application smoothly.
    \item \textbf{Software Dependencies:} It is assumed that any third-party
    libraries or frameworks used by \progname are stable, compatible, and
    function as intended on the target operating systems. 
\end{enumerate}
