\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Access Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item \textbf{ACR1.} \textbf{Users will not be able to access documents and notes written by other users.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Storage Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item \textbf{SR1.} \textbf{Usersâ€™ notes will be stored locally on their devices.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Upload Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item \textbf{UR1.} \textbf{Users will not be able to upload specific file types (i.e., .exe, .js, .bat, .sh) to prevent malicious file uploads.}
    \item \textbf{UR2.} \textbf{Uploads will be stored in a secure directory that is not publicly accessible.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Integrity Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item \textbf{IR1.} \textbf{The application will not modify any user-written data unnecessarily.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Code Requirements}list
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item \textbf{CR1.} \textbf{Code dependencies will be kept up to date.}
    \item \textbf{CR2.} \textbf{Debug logs and stack traces will not be exposed and will produce generic error messages instead.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

All the safety requirements listed in the FMEA table will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline. Contrarily, regarding the 
above section 6. Safety and Security Requirements will all be implemented as part of the capstone timeline, except 
the Access Requirements, as cloud save is not part of our capstone timeline.

    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?

    \end{itemize} 
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
