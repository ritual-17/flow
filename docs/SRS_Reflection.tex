  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - 
        \item Ethan - Something that went well while working on the SRS was the
          elicitation of requirements that are maybe not necessarily new or
          specific to our product, but are necessary for it to be successful
          and usable. In our first deliverable problem statement we focused
          mostly on selling points and novel functionality, but in this
          document we fleshed out more practical requirements for what a note
          taking app should have. This included requirements such as the need
          to be able to save files. This is an obvious requirement, but
          sometimes it is easy to skip over documenting them because they are
          almost implicit.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - 
        \item Ethan - One part of this deliverable that was challenging was
          splitting up the work and working in parallel with my team members.
          The sections in this document are very inter-related, so it required
          lots of discussion to make sure we were all on the same page. To
          overcome this, we made sure to ask questions as they arose and
          discuss. Another challenge was organization and tracking of work
          tasks. There were many more parts to work on here than our previous
          deliverable, so it was that much more important to track big tasks
          (e.g. deliverable work) and small tasks (e.g. document formatting and
          folder clean up chores) to make sure everything gets done. Overall,
          we came up with a system that works well and allows us to view
          relevant tasks in our kanban board sorted by milestone.

  \end{itemize} 
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - 
        \item Ethan - Since our group members align a lot with our stakeholder
          characteristics, all of our requirements were created as a result of
          discussion about what we would find useful and beneficial in the
          product within our group.

  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - 
        \item Ethan - Many courses have had relevant material to help us in
          this project. From a technical perspective, some that come to mind
          include 2AA4 and 3A04. These two courses heavily focused on the
          design of software systems and collaborating in a team while doing
          so, just on a smaller scale than what we are doing in capstone. From
          a requirements perspective, 3RA3 and 4HC3 are extremely relevant, as
          we learned about requirements, why they are important, and how to use
          them to deliver a good product to users.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.

        \item Chengze - 
        \item Ethan - 
        \item Hussain - 
        \item Jeffrey - 
        \item Kevin - 
  \end{itemize} 
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
