\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - I was responsible for the systems section, and 
        I think the structure and logic of the document came together 
        well. Once I clearly understood how each subsystem interacted, 
        writing the descriptions became much easier. Collaborating with 
        teammates also helped ensure that my section aligned with the 
        overall SRS structure.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - It was challenging to work on my section(Systems) without 
        constant communication since the system design depended on finalized 
        functional requirements from other parts of the SRS. I resolved this 
        by checking the latest commits regularly and syncing with the team when 
        major updates were made to ensure consistency across sections.

        \item Hussain - 
        \item Jeffrey - 
        \item Kevin - 
  \end{itemize} 
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Most of the requirements were based on internal design discussions 
        rather than external feedback. As we are students ourselves, many of the 
        requirements would have naturally came from our own ideas. Reviewing 
        similar note-taking tools and discussing usability with peers helped 
        identify which system functions would feel most natural to users, such 
        as the canvas-based note interface.
  \end{itemize} 
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - My experience in Software Design and Software Requirements 
        and Specifications has been especially useful. These courses taught me how 
        to break down systems into components, identify functional dependencies, and 
        document them clearly — all of which directly applied to writing the systems section.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - From a systems perspective, we’ll need a stronger understanding 
        of client–server communication and data handling. Personally, I also want to 
        improve in designing scalable architectures and integrating front-end and back-end 
        components effectively.

        \item Hussain - 
        \item Jeffrey - 
        \item Kevin - 
  \end{itemize} 
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \begin{itemize}
        \item Chengze - To strengthen my system design and integration skills, 
        I plan to study open-source architecture examples and practice by setting 
        up small demo projects that connect APIs and front-end interfaces. I’ll also 
        review documentation on frameworks our team uses to understand their structure 
        better. Hands-on learning and reviewing teammates’ implementations will help 
        me apply theory to our project quickly.
