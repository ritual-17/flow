This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.


\section{Demo Plans}


For our Rev0 Demo we plan to showcase taking a note that involves drawing a state machine, 
writing some text, and quick navigation around the note. We will then discuss future plans for the development of Rev1.

\section{CICD via GitHub Actions}

CI/CD is being used to compile, lint, format, and run tests on our codebase.
The pipeline is run on every PR and needs to pass before it can be merged. It
is also run on every merge to the main branch.

LaTex workflow: \url{https://github.com/ritual-17/flow/blob/main/.github/workflows/buildtex.yml} \\

Ascii doctor workflow (for SRS): \url{https://github.com/ritual-17/flow/blob/main/.github/workflows/buildadoc.yaml} \\

\section{Extras}

Our team plans to work on a User Manual and Usability Report as our extras. The
usability testing will be designed after Rev 0 and testing will be conducted to
include findings in the Verification and Validation report. The User Manual
will be created alongside the development process for Rev 1. We still feel
these extras are appropriate.

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

For Revision 0, our team did not use a strict set of quantified trigger items, but
 we followed general expectations such as completing assigned tasks on time, communicating
 regularly, and staying involved in team progress. No major issues or violations
 occurred during this revision, as everyone contributed consistently. In future revisions,
 we plan to define clearer and more measurable triggers to help track productivity and
 address any problems more effectively.

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

Our team does not have any additional metrics of productivity aside from
the ones listed in this report.
