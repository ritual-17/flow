\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}

\wss{What will you be demonstrating}
For our Rev0 Demo we plan to showcase taking a note that involves drawing a state machine, writing some text, and quick navigation around the note.
\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}
Our group did not have any meeting up to the time of this productivity report. Our group used asynchronous communication via discord and github to delegate and complete tasks. 

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

For Revision 0, our team did not use a strict set of quantified trigger items, but
 we followed general expectations such as completing assigned tasks on time, communicating
 regularly, and staying involved in team progress. No major issues or violations
 occurred during this revision, as everyone contributed consistently. In future revisions,
 we plan to define clearer and more measurable triggers to help track productivity and
 address any problems more effectively.

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

Our team does not have any additional metrics of productivity aside from
the ones listed in this report.
