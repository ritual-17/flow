== Introduction
We have chosen the Meyer template for our Software Requirements Specification
document. While our document follows the provided template for the most part, the
following changes were made:

* Added this Introduction section.
* Removed individual section control info. We removed these because we felt it
  was too granular for the changes and rounds of feedback we will be using for
  this document. The overall document control info is still included.
