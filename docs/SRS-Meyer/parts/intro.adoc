== Introduction
We have chosen the Meyer template for our Software Requirements Specification
document. While our document follows the provided template for the most part, the
following changes were made:

* Added this Introduction section.
* Removed author biography section. We felt that this was unnecessary.
* Removed individual section control info. We removed these because we felt it
  was too granular for the changes and rounds of feedback we will be using for
  this document. The overall document control info is still included, but it
  was updated to include the "Developers" and "Change" columns.
* Added an S7.adoc under the system directory. This addition corresponds to the
  request made in the Hazard Analysis document to include the additional 
  safety and security requirements made there into the SRS.
