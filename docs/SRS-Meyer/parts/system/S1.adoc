The {project-title} system relies on the following software components:

* **Frontend User Interface** – Provides an interactive canvas-based workspace where users can create, edit, and navigate notes. Supports text formatting, folder organization, and insertion of geometric shapes.

* **Canvas Manager** – Handles spatial organization and user interaction for note elements (text boxes and shapes). Supports panning, positioning, resizing, and movement of objects on the canvas.

* **Rendering Engine** – Renders text and geometric shapes in real time, maintaining visual accuracy during edits, movements, and scaling. Ensures smooth visual updates and consistent element alignment.

* **Shortcut Command Processor** – Interprets keyboard inputs to trigger editing, navigation, and formatting actions. Supports customizable keybindings, macros, and command conflict detection.

* **Data Management and Storage** – Manages creation, retrieval, autosave, and deletion of notes. Maintains version history and folder hierarchies while ensuring data integrity.

* **Configuration and Customization** – Stores and applies user preferences such as layout, theme, and shortcut mappings. Provides mechanisms to reset or restore default settings.

* **Backend Logic and API Layer** – Handles local persistence and, where applicable, provides an interface for synchronization or external service integration. Ensures consistent behavior across user sessions.
