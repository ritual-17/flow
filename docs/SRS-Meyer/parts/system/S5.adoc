=== (S.5) Prioritization

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Classification of the behaviors, interfaces and scenarios (<<s2>>, <<s3>> and <<s4>>) by their degree of criticality. It is useful in particular if during the course of the project various pressures force the team to drop certain functions._  <<BM22>>

==== (S.5.1) Functional Requirements Prioritization

|===
| Requirement ID | Description | Priority | Rationale

| F211 | Create, open, edit, and delete notes | **High** | Fundamental to all system operations; without it, the app cannot fulfill its main purpose.  
| F212 | Organize notes into folders and subfolders | **High** | Core for content management and navigation.  
| F213 | Insert text boxes and edit content | **High** | Enables primary user interaction for note-taking.  
| F214 | Insert predefined geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, etc.) | **High** | Core to diagramming capability and differentiates the app from plain text editors.  
| F215 | Move, resize, and position text boxes or shapes | **High** | Essential for flexible diagram creation.  
| F216 | Pan and zoom canvas | **Medium** | Important for large diagrams but not critical to minimal function.  
| F217 | Save and load notes from local storage | **High** | Data persistence and continuity.  
| F218 | Export notes (PDF, PNG, Markdown) | **Medium** | Important for sharing, but not needed for MVP.  
| F219 | Undo/redo editing actions | **Medium** | Improves usability; can be implemented incrementally.  
| F220 | Optional: sync or backup to cloud | **Low** | Value-add feature, non-critical for core offline operation.

==== (S.5.2) Non-Functional Requirements Prioritization

|===
| Requirement ID | Description | Priority | Rationale

| NF211 | Low-latency input and rendering (≤30ms response) | **High** | Critical for responsiveness and user satisfaction.  
| NF212 | Local data persistence and autosave | **High** | Prevents data loss; essential for reliability.  
| NF213 | Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux) | **Medium** | Important for accessibility, can be phased after MVP.  
| NF214 | Accessible keyboard shortcuts and discoverable command palette | **High** | Core to product identity and usability.  
| NF215 | File integrity during save/export (atomic operations) | **High** | Ensures stability and prevents corruption.  
| NF216 | Security of local data (no background network traffic) | **Medium** | Supports user privacy, non-blocking for MVP.  
| NF217 | Visual consistency and intuitive UI layout | **Medium** | Improves user experience, can evolve iteratively.  
| NF218 | Performance at scale (500+ elements) | **Low** | Optimization target for later releases.  
|===

==== (S.5.3) Interface and Scenario Prioritization

|===
| Interface / Scenario | Priority | Rationale

| User interface for note editing (canvas, text boxes, shapes) | **High** | Central to all use cases.  
| File I/O interface (open/save/export) | **High** | Necessary for persistence.  
| Keyboard command interface | **High** | Defining feature of {project-title}; critical for workflow efficiency.  
| Shape palette and geometry insertion interface | **Medium** | Adds value but not blocking to MVP.  
| Optional sign-in/sync interface | **Low** | Useful enhancement but out of scope for current build.

==== (S.5.4) Prioritization Summary

===== High Priority
Core functionality necessary for a minimal viable product:

* Text and diagram creation/editing — F211–F215, NF211–NF214
* Local save/load and autosave — F217, NF212, NF215
* Keyboard command interface and discoverability

===== Medium Priority
Enhancements that improve usability and reach:

* Canvas navigation and export features — F216, F218
* Cross-platform compatibility and UI refinement — NF213, NF217

===== Low Priority
Future or extended features beyond MVP:

* Cloud sync and user profiles — F220
* Large document optimization — NF218
* Extended collaboration or plugin systems



==== (S.5.5) Requirement Traceability Summary

The following table summarizes cross-references between functional (F) and non-functional (NF) requirements, showing how system behaviors rely on supporting qualities such as performance, usability, and reliability.

|===
| Requirement ID | Related Requirements | Relationship Type

| F211 | NF211, NF214 | Functional editing depends on responsive input and accessible keyboard controls.
| F212 | NF217 | Folder organization relies on consistent and intuitive UI layout.
| F213 | NF211, NF214 | Text editing requires low-latency input and keyboard shortcut support.
| F214 | NF211, NF217 | Shape insertion depends on responsive rendering and consistent visuals.
| F215 | NF211 | Moving and resizing objects depend on smooth frame updates and responsiveness.
| F216 | NF211, NF217 | Canvas navigation performance linked to input responsiveness and UI clarity.
| F217 | NF212, NF215 | Save/load operations depend on autosave and file integrity guarantees.
| F218 | NF215 | Exporting notes depends on reliable file handling.
| F219 | NF211, NF215 | Undo/redo relies on efficient rendering and reliable state management.
| F220 | NF216 | Cloud sync depends on secure and private local data handling.

| NF211 | F213–F219 | Input latency affects all core editing functions.
| NF212 | F217 | Autosave directly supports data persistence.
| NF214 | F211, F213 | Keyboard accessibility enhances main editing workflow.
| NF215 | F217–F219 | File integrity underpins all save/export functions.
| NF217 | F212, F214, F216 | UI layout consistency supports organizational and diagramming tasks.
