ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**”. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>

==== (S.2.7) Basis for Design and Requirements Stability

This section makes inputs/outputs explicit and classifies requirements by likelihood of change so an external team could design, build, and test from this document.

===== Inputs and Outputs (Overview)

|===
| Component | Inputs | Outputs

| Editor | Keyboard shortcuts, text entry, pointer events | Updated canvas model (text blocks, shapes), selection state, feedback messages
| Shortcut Command Processor | Key events, user keybinding config | Dispatched editor actions, conflict warnings/help overlay
| Rendering Engine | Canvas model, viewport (pan/zoom), style/theme | On-screen frames, redraw events
| Document Management | File paths, save/load/export/version requests | Persisted files, autosave snapshots, exported PDFs/PNGs/Markdown, version IDs
| Configuration & Customization | Preference changes (theme, keybindings), session state | Stored settings, applied themes/keymaps, restored workspace
| Collaboration & Export | Share/export requests, clipboard ops | Shared/exported artifacts, clipboard content
|===

===== Unlikely to Change (Stable Baseline)

* **Core editing & layout:** <<F211>>, <<F212>>, <<F214>>, <<F215>>, <<F216>>  
* **Navigation & rendering basics:** <<F217>>, <<F231>>–<<F235>>  
* **File operations & autosave:** <<F241>>, <<F242>>, <<F243>>  
* **Reliability & integrity:** <<NF241>>, <<NF215>> (via <<F241>>–<<F244>>)  
* **Responsiveness & usability:** <<NF211>>, <<NF212>>, <<NF214>>  
These define the essential product behavior and quality bar and are expected to remain stable across the project.

===== Likely to Change (Evolving / Context-Dependent)

* **Advanced commands & customization:** <<F222>>, <<F223>>, <<F224>>, <<F252>>  
* **Export surface & integration hooks:** <<F243>>, <<F261>> (formats/APIs may evolve with feedback)  
* **Versioning policy & folder sync details:** <<F244>>, <<F245>>  
* **Security & scalability targets (if sync or large docs expand):** <<NF216>>, <<NF233>>, <<NF218>>, cross-platform polish <<NF213>>  
These items depend on user feedback, platform constraints, or future scope and may be refined iteratively.

==== Implementation Status – Revision 0
As of Revision 0, the current prototype demonstrates the core editor capabilities, including shape creation and manipulation, arrow connections, creation and 
modification of textboxes, Vim-style text navigation, and general vim-style editing commands applicable to the canvas elements. Basic shortcut command functionality
is partially implemented to support key interactions (copy/paste, undo/redo, shape insertion) as shown in the demo. Features related to document persistence, 
including creating, opening, saving, and deleting notes, as well as advanced configuration, collaboration, and extended document management, are specified in the 
SRS but are not implemented in this revision. The current system operates entirely in memory and is intended to showcase core editing and rendering functionality.
