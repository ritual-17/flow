=== (G.1) Context and Overall Objectives

TIP: _High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system. It explains why the project is needed, recalls the business context, and presents the general business objectives._  <<BM22>>

{project-title} is designed to address gaps in existing note-taking systems,
which lack efficient methods for integrating text and diagrams through a
unified keyboard-driven workflow. Current solutions impose trade-offs in speed,
flexibility, and workflow continuity, as explored in <<G.2>>.

The goal of {project-title} is to create an intuitive system that allows for
keyboard-driven creation and editing of notes involving text and diagrams.
Although there is an expectation that there will be a learning curve to become
proficient with the system, the intended benefit is that the user will be able
to create and edit notes more quickly than with existing systems.
