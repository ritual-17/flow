=== (P.2) Imposed technical choices

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Any a priori choices binding the project to specific tools, hardware, languages or other technical parameters. Not all technical choices in projects derive from a pure technical analysis; some result from company policies. While some project members may dislike non-strictly-technical decisions, they are a fact of project life and must be documented, in particular for the benefit of one of the quality factors for requirements: "requirements must be justified"._  <<BM22>>

* Hardware Binding Technical Choices
    **Must be used on a laptop, desktop, and/or personal computer
    **Must mainly run using a keyboard with minimal to zero mouse/trackpad involvment
    **Must be usable without requiring a dGPU
    **Minimal System Requirments:
        ***CPU:
        ***GPU:
        ***Memory:
        ***Storage:.

* Hardware Binding Justification:
    **The application must be easily accessible. Having {project-title} run on a variety of devices aligns with the company's goal of having an easily accessible note taking application for all students in technical disciplines.
    Having lower system requirments ensures that the application reaches a wider group of students who usually cannot afford expensive setups and/or devices.
    **The binding constraint of having mostly if not only keyboard involvment stems from the project's goal of developing a note taking application which allows students to easily take notes and construct diagrams in class seemlessly using a keyboard.


* Software Binding Technical Choices
    **Must be a standalone application
    **Must not be an extension to a pre-exisiting note taking application
    **Must be usable on IOS, Windows, and Linux operated devices
    **Must be written in ___________

*Software Binding Justification:
    **Having a standalone application and not an extension is an imposed technical choice as it is contributes the capstone's requirment of meeting a set complexity level.
    This technical choice also aligns with the group's goal of having more freedom in the software's UI and keybindings. Being an extension restricts the available bindings
    accessible to our program.
    **Having the software run on multiple operating systems aligns with the company's goal of reaching a wider audience of students and making the application more accessible.
    **The coding language technical choice stems from how comfortable each member of this team is with the language
