=== (P.5) Required technology elements

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _External systems, hardware and software, expected to be necessary for building the system. It lists external technology elements, such as program libraries and hardware devices, that the project is expected to require. Although the actual use of such products belongs to design and implementation rather than requirements, it is part of the requirements task to identify elements whose availability is critical to the success of the project â€” an important element of risk analysis (<<p6>>)._  <<BM22>>

Throughout the development of Flow, a combination of software and hardware systems will be required to ensure effective implementation, testing, and deployment. While the system's core functionality of translating user keyboard input seamlessly into both text and visual diagrams can operate without specific frameworks, certain external technologies will be required for supporting successful user interaction, visualization, and overall system performance.

External software systems that are expected to be included are:

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Frameworks**: To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, GUI frameworks (such as Electon) will be necessary. These frameworks facilitate the development of cross-platform applications, ensuring that Flow can run on various operating systems without any compatibility issues.

* **Graphics / Rendering Libraries**: For rendering shapes or visual diagrams, rendering libraries will be required. These libraries provide robust tools for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations, which are essential for the integration of diagrams into a note-taking environment for Flow.

* **Parser / DSL Libraries**: To interpret text-based commands and convert them into visual elements, parser libraries or domain-specific language (DSL) tools will be necessary. These libraries help in efficiently processing user input and translating it into the desired graphical representations.

* **Drawing Libraries**: To facilitate the creation and manipulation of custom diagrams, drawing libraries will be required. These libraries would offer functionalities for creating shapes, lines, and other graphical elements that users can interact with within the Flow application.

External hardware systems that may be required include:

* **Keyboard (Primary Input Device)**: As Flow is designed to translate keyboard input into text and diagrams, a standard keyboard will be essential for user interaction. The keyboard serves as the primary input device, allowing users to enter the commands and text efficiently.
